##Introduction
This is my capstone project at Coursera - IBM Data Science Course. I'll be comparing two different cities to solve a business problem. 
Now I'd like to introduce you the business problem that I have choosen to solve. 
Throughout this project my focus will be onto the question of where is the best place to open a coffee place in Toronto. 
Deciding the best location is important is an important factor especially for the competition and reaching to the right customer base.
My expectations from the location is being in a center of interest of both the locals and tourists. 
Also it'd be a plus to being close to seaside and all kind of transportation such as trams, bus and metros. 
And of course it is important to be somewhere safe at day and night. 
Competition is not a bad thing but it is not the goal being the one of the hundreds. 
That is why, one of the factors are competition around the location. 
With this project I'm going to analyse the neighborhoods of the city Toronto and eliminate some of them while on my way to find the best location. 
##Data Section
While solving this problem I'll use Jupyter Notebooks and Foursquare APIs. Because with the Foursquare Data, I can find out a lot about locations of other coffee places and eliminate through the best location.
